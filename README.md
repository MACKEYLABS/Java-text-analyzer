# Java-text-analyzer

Requirements/Planning: Write a Java text analyzer program that reads a file and outputs statistics about that file. It should output the word frequencies of all words in the file, sorted by the most frequently used word. The output should be a set of pairs, each pair containing a word and how many times it occurred in the file.
Comments: Any word file can be used in the projects source file to be read from and written to but for this project we will be reading and writing to “The Raven” poem by Edgar Allan Poe.
